# GoTo-System

This is a simple plugin created for a network, which I then decided to release to everyone. What this plugin does is add the /goto command that allows you to go from one server to another without having to do /server.


## Command:
- /goto <server>

## Permissions:
- goto.command | To use the command
- goto.command.tabcomplete | To have the tabcomplete in the command.

WARNING: This command only works on BungeeCord or one of its forks!

It is strictly forbidden to peddle the plugin as your own.
