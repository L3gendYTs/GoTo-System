# GoTo-System

This is a simple plugin created for a network, which I then decided to release to everyone. What this plugin does is add the /goto command that allows you to go from one server to another without having to do /server.


## Command:
- /goto <server> o /connect <server>
- /gotoreload

## Permissions:
- goto.command | To use the command
- goto.reload | To reload the plugin!
- goto.update | To receive plugin update notifications!


## Config example/backup
```yaml
#           ______      __
#          / ____/___  / /_____
#         / / __/ __ \/ __/ __ \
